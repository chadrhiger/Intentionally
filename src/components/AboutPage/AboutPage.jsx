        <h5>Many of us would like to make positive changes to our physical and mental health. 
          But our fast-paced, maximum-effort for maximum-reward modern life can 
          leave us physically drained and mentally scattered. 
          It’s easy to beat ourselves up when we’re trying to build ourselves up.</h5> 

          <h5>So I thought, “I would love an app that just gently reminded me to live intentionally, 
            but in small, incremental doses. Something that would help me “game” my brain’s natural 
            reward system without the distraction and counterproductive efforts of the reflexive 
            self-shaming to which so many of us are prone.” We don’t need a lot of time, 
            we don’t need some complicated system. We just need some self-acceptance and 
            a little push toward more mindful practices.</h5>

          <h5>To that end, I made this app because I wanted to 
            remember to take the time to live in small moments, 
            and give myself the acceptance to turn small intentions 
            into bigger, positive changes.</h5>

          <h5>With Intentionally, our user is encouraged to create modest, 
            incremental goals or “intentions” toward bringing some small 
            soundness to their mind and body. A minute or two of 
            silent reflection on gratitude. A kindly note-to-self to opt for a 
            healthier food or travel option once in a while. 
            No pressure, just acceptance and encouragement.</h5>
