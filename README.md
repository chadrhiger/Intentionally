# Intentionally
Many of us would like to make positive changes to our physical and mental health. But our fast-paced, maximum-effort for maximum-reward modern life can leave us physically drained and mentally scattered. It’s easy to beat ourselves up when we’re trying to build ourselves up.

So I thought, “I would love an app that just gently reminded me to live intentionally, but in small, incremental doses. Something that would help me “game” my brain’s natural reward system without the distraction and counterproductive efforts of the reflexive self-shaming to which so many of us are prone.” We don’t need a lot of time, we don’t need some complicated system. We just need some self-acceptance and a little push toward more mindful practices.

To that end, I made this app because I wanted to remember to take the time to live in small moments, and give myself the acceptance to turn small intentions into bigger, positive changes.

With Intentionally, our user is encouraged to create modest, incremental goals or “intentions” toward bringing some small soundness to their mind and body. A minute or two of silent reflection on gratitude. A kindly note-to-self to opt for a healthier food or travel option once in a while. No pressure, just acceptance and encouragement.
